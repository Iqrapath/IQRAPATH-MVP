## ⏰ **Countdown Timer Logic**

### **PHP Calculation** (Server-Side)

```php
@php
    $now = \Carbon\Carbon::now();
    $diff = $now->diff($scheduledDate);
    $totalDays = $diff->days;
    $days = $diff->d;
    $hours = $diff->h;
    $minutes = $diff->i;
    $isPast = $scheduledDate->isPast();
    
    // Calculate early access time (30 minutes before)
    $earlyAccessTime = $scheduledDate->copy()->subMinutes(30);
    $canAccessNow = $now->gte($earlyAccessTime);
@endphp
```

### **Display Format**

**Countdown Grid (4 Boxes):**
```
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│  5  │ │ 14  │ │ 32  │ │ 45  │
│DAYS │ │HOURS│ │ MIN │ │ SEC │
└─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘
