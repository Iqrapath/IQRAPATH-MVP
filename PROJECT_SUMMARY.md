# Project Summary

## Design System Enforcement (June 2024)

### Overview
This project enforces a strict design system for all UI development. The design system includes a specific color palette, font families, and typography rules. All custom styles and components must adhere to these tokens. Tailwind CSS is used for utility classes, but all color and font utilities are overridden by the design system.

### Key Actions Taken
- **CSS Updated:**
  - Defined only the design system's color palette (Midnight Blue, White, Greyscale 50-900) as CSS variables in `app.css`.
  - Defined only the design system's font families (Nunito, Inter, Poppins) as CSS variables.
  - All heading, body, and button styles are set to match the design system's font, size, weight, and line height.
  - Utility classes for all body and button text styles are included for consistent use.
  - Comments added to clarify that only these tokens should be usedâ€”no Tailwind default colors or fonts.
  - `.btn` class updated to match the design system's button style (border-radius, padding, border, color, background, cursor, transition).

### Developer Guidance
- **Booking System:**
  - Use the `Booking` model's `createSession()` method to generate teaching sessions from approved bookings
  - The booking system handles the scheduling, while the session system tracks the actual teaching events
  - All booking changes should be recorded in the `booking_history` table

- **Session Management:**
  - Sessions are automatically created from approved bookings
  - Use the `TeachingSession` model's methods for attendance tracking
  - Session materials should be uploaded through the `SessionMaterial` model

- **Zoom Integration:**
  - Zoom API credentials must be set in the `.env` file:
    ```
    ZOOM_API_KEY=your_zoom_api_key
    ZOOM_API_SECRET=your_zoom_api_secret
    ```
  - For production, set up a Zoom webhook with the endpoint `/api/zoom/webhook`
  - Subscribe to meeting.started, meeting.ended, meeting.participant_joined, and meeting.participant_left events

- **Design System:**
  - **Do not use** Tailwind's default color or font utilities. Use only the CSS variables and classes defined in `app.css`.
  - All new components and pages must use the design system tokens for color, font, and typography.
  - If you need to add new design tokens (e.g., spacing, border radius), update `app.css` and document the change here.
  - For email templates, use the custom components in `resources/views/vendor/mail/html/` to maintain brand consistency.
  - When adding new authentication features, follow the established patterns for form design and validation.
