# Project Summary

## Design System Enforcement (June 2024)

### Overview
This project enforces a strict design system for all UI development. The design system includes a specific color palette, font families, and typography rules. All custom styles and components must adhere to these tokens. Tailwind CSS is used for utility classes, but all color and font utilities are overridden by the design system.

### Key Actions Taken
- **CSS Updated:**
  - Defined only the design system's color palette (Midnight Blue, White, Greyscale 50-900) as CSS variables in `app.css`.
  - Defined only the design system's font families (Nunito, Inter, Poppins) as CSS variables.
  - All heading, body, and button styles are set to match the design system's font, size, weight, and line height.
  - Utility classes for all body and button text styles are included for consistent use.
  - Comments added to clarify that only these tokens should be usedâ€”no Tailwind default colors or fonts.
  - `.btn` class updated to match the design system's button style (border-radius, padding, border, color, background, cursor, transition).

## Authentication System Redesign (July 2024)

### Overview
The authentication system UI has been completely redesigned to match the new design system and improve user experience. This includes login, registration, and password reset flows.

### Key Actions Taken
- **Authentication Pages Redesigned:**
  - Login page updated with new layout, form fields, and social login options

### Developer Guidance
- **Booking System:**
  - Use the `Booking` model's `createSession()` method to generate teaching sessions from approved bookings
  - The booking system handles the scheduling, while the session system tracks the actual teaching events
  - All booking changes should be recorded in the `booking_history` table
  - Use the booking status workflow to manage the lifecycle:
    ```php
    $booking->status = 'approved';
    $booking->approved_by_id = auth()->id();
    $booking->approved_at = now();
    $booking->save();
    
    // Create session automatically after approval
    $session = $booking->createSession();
    ```

- **Session Management:**
  - Sessions are automatically created from approved bookings
  - Use the `TeachingSession` model's methods for attendance tracking:
    ```php
    $session->markTeacherPresent();
    $session->markStudentPresent();
    $session->recordJoinTime('teacher', now());
    ```
  - Session materials should be uploaded through the `SessionMaterial` model:
    ```php
    SessionMaterial::create([
        'session_id' => $session->id,
        'title' => 'Lesson Slides',
        'description' => 'Slides for today\'s lesson',
        'file_path' => $filePath,
        'file_type' => 'application/pdf',
        'uploaded_by_id' => auth()->id()
    ]);
    ```
  - Track session progress for student achievement:
    ```php
    SessionProgress::create([
        'session_id' => $session->id,
        'topic_covered' => 'Introduction to Tajweed',
        'proficiency_level' => 'beginner',

    ```
  - For production, set up a Zoom webhook with the endpoint `/api/zoom/webhook`
  - Subscribe to meeting.started, meeting.ended, meeting.participant_joined, and meeting.participant_left events
  - Use the ZoomService for meeting management:
    ```php
    $zoomData = ZoomService::createMeeting([
        'topic' => "Session with {$student->name}",
        'start_time' => $session->session_date . ' ' . $session->start_time,
        'duration' => $session->duration_minutes
    ]);
    
    $session->update([
        'zoom_meeting_id' => $zoomData['id'],
        'zoom_host_id' => $zoomData['host_id'],
        'zoom_join_url' => $zoomData['join_url'],
        'zoom_start_url' => $zoomData['start_url'],
        'zoom_password' => $zoomData['password']
    ]);
    ```

- **Teacher Availability:**
  - Manage teacher schedules through the TeacherAvailability model:
    ```php
    TeacherAvailability::create([
        'teacher_id' => $teacher->id,
        'day_of_week' => 1, // Monday
        'start_time' => '09:00:00',
        'end_time' => '12:00:00',
        'is_active' => true
    ]);
    ```
  - Check availability before booking:
    ```php
    $isAvailable = $teacher->isAvailableAt(
        $date,
        $startTime,
        $endTime
    );
    ```

- **Notification System:**
  - Create booking notifications:
    ```php
    BookingNotification::create([
        'user_id' => $booking->student_id,
        'booking_id' => $booking->id,
        'type' => 'booking_approved',
        'message' => 'Your booking has been approved',
        'is_read' => false
    ]);
    ```
  - Send email reminders:
    ```php
    Mail::to($booking->student->email)
        ->send(new BookingReminderMail($booking));
    ```

          'instructor' => 'Sheikh Abdullah',
      ]);
      ```
  - Access learning progress through the User model's `learningProgress()` relationship:
    ```php
    $progressRecords = $user->learningProgress;
    $quranProgress = $user->learningProgress()->where('subject_id', $quranSubject->id)->first();
    ```

- **Progress Calculation:**
  - Progress percentage is automatically calculated based on completed vs. total sessions:
    ```php
    // If 5 of 20 sessions are completed, progress will be 25%
    $progress->completed_sessions = 5;
    $progress->total_sessions = 20;
    $progress->updateProgressPercentage(); // Sets progress_percentage to 25
    ```
  - Milestones and certificates are stored as JSON arrays with timestamps:
    ```php
    // Example milestone structure
    [
        {
            "title": "Completed Chapter 1",
            "description": "Successfully recited Surah Al-Fatiha",
            "completed_at": "2024-07-23 15:30:45"
        }
    ]
    
    // Example certificate structure
    [
        {
            "title": "Tajweed Basics",
            "level": "Beginner",

            "issued_at": "2024-07-23 16:45:22"
        }
    ]
    ```

## Teacher Verification Request System (July 2024)

### Overview
A robust teacher verification system has been implemented to ensure quality and trust across the platform. The system supports document review, live video verification (with Zoom and Google Meet integration), status tracking, audit logging, and admin review workflows.

### Key Actions Taken
- **Database Structure:**
  - Created `verification_requests` table to track each teacher's verification event, including:
    - Status (pending, verified, rejected, live_video)
    - Document and video verification status
    - Scheduled call info (date, platform, meeting link)
    - Admin review and rejection reason
    - Submission and review timestamps
  - Created `verification_calls` table to support scheduling and rescheduling of video calls:
    - Platform (Zoom, Google Meet, other)
    - Meeting link, notes, status, and creator
  - Created `verification_audit_logs` table to maintain a full audit trail of status changes and actions:
    - Status, changed_by, changed_at, notes
  - All tables are linked to the appropriate teacher profile and user accounts for full traceability.

- **Model Relationships:**
  - `TeacherProfile` has many `VerificationRequest`
  - `VerificationRequest` has many `VerificationCall` and `VerificationAuditLog`
  - `VerificationRequest` belongs to `TeacherProfile` and reviewer (User)
  - `VerificationCall` belongs to `VerificationRequest` and creator (User)
  - `VerificationAuditLog` belongs to `VerificationRequest` and changer (User)

- **Zoom & Video Integration:**
  - The system supports both Zoom and Google Meet for live video verification calls
  - If Zoom is selected, the platform leverages the existing Zoom integration for meeting creation and management
  - Meeting links and metadata are stored in the verification call records

- **Document Review:**
  - Each verification request is associated with the teacher's documents (ID, certificates, resume)
  - Document statuses are tracked and can be reviewed, verified, or rejected by admins

- **Audit Trail:**
  - Every status change or significant action on a verification request is logged in the audit table
  - Provides a full history for compliance and transparency

### Developer Guidance
- **Verification Requests:**
  - Use the `VerificationRequest` model to manage the lifecycle of teacher verification
  - Schedule or reschedule calls using the `VerificationCall` model
  - Log status changes and actions using the `VerificationAuditLog` model
  - Link verification requests to teacher profiles and admin reviewers

- **Video Call Integration:**
  - When scheduling a call, set the `platform` to 'zoom' or 'google_meet' and store the meeting link
  - For Zoom, use the platform's Zoom integration service to generate and manage meetings

- **Document Review:**
  - Access and update document statuses via the `Document` model and its relationship to `TeacherProfile`
  - Use the verification request's `docs_status` to reflect the overall document review state

- **Audit Logging:**
  - Log every status change or admin action using the `VerificationAuditLog` model for traceability

- **Frontend Integration:**
  - The verification system supports UI requirements for:
    - Listing and filtering verification requests
    - Reviewing and updating document and video statuses
    - Scheduling and managing video calls
    - Viewing audit history and admin actions
