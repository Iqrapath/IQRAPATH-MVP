echo "==============================================\n\n";

echo "Since OAuth setup is complex, let's use a simpler approach:\n\n";

echo "📋 Option 1: Use Google Meet Direct Links\n";
echo "=========================================\n";
echo "You can create Google Meet links directly without OAuth:\n";
echo "1. Go to: https://meet.google.com/\n";
echo "2. Click 'Start a meeting'\n";
echo "3. Copy the meeting link\n";
echo "4. Use that link in your verification calls\n\n";

echo "📋 Option 2: Use Zoom Instead (Recommended)\n";
echo "===========================================\n";
echo "Since Zoom is already working, use it for verification calls:\n";
echo "1. Go to Admin > Verification\n";
echo "2. Select 'Zoom' in the platform dropdown\n";
echo "3. Click 'Generate Meeting Link'\n";
echo "4. It should work immediately\n\n";

echo "📋 Option 3: Manual Meeting Links\n";
echo "=================================\n";
echo "For any platform (Teams, Skype, etc.):\n";
echo "1. Select 'Other Platform' in the dropdown\n";
echo "2. Enter meeting links manually\n";
echo "3. Schedule verification calls\n\n";

echo "🎯 RECOMMENDATION: Use Zoom for now\n";
echo "===================================\n";
echo "Zoom is already configured and working.\n";
echo "You can set up Google Meet OAuth later when you have more time.\n\n";

echo "Would you like to:\n";
echo "1. Test Zoom integration (recommended)\n";
echo "2. Continue with Google Meet OAuth setup\n";
echo "3. Use manual meeting links\n\n";

$choice = trim(fgets(STDIN));

switch ($choice) {
    case '1':
        echo "\n✅ Great choice! Zoom is already working.\n";
        echo "Go to Admin > Verification and select 'Zoom' platform.\n";
        break;
    case '2':
        echo "\n🔄 Continuing with Google Meet OAuth setup...\n";
        echo "Make sure you've added the redirect URI to Google Cloud Console.\n";
        break;
    case '3':
        echo "\n✅ Manual links work great too!\n";
        echo "Select 'Other Platform' and enter any meeting link.\n";
