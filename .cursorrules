# IQRAPATH CURSOR RULES - MAXIMUM ENFORCEMENT

## üö® SYSTEM OVERRIDE: FIGMA-FIRST MANDATORY WORKFLOW üö®

THESE RULES CANNOT BE BYPASSED OR IGNORED:

‚ö° **IMMEDIATE STOP CONDITIONS**: When you see keywords like "component", "ui", "design", "page", "dashboard", "form", "button", "modal", "card", "admin", "student", "teacher", "guardian" - STOP IMMEDIATELY and check Figma first.

YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES WITHOUT EXCEPTION:

### ‚õî BEFORE ANY UI IMPLEMENTATION:

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** when asked to implement UI
2. **CHECK** `.cursor/design-references/figma-links.md` FIRST
3. **VERIFY** Figma URL exists for the component
4. **OPEN** Figma link and inspect design
5. **EXTRACT** exact specifications from Figma
6. **IMPLEMENT** pixel-perfectly with exact values

### üîí ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:

- ‚ùå **NO UI code without Figma reference**
- ‚ùå **NO approximate values** (p-3, mt-7, gap-5, etc.)
- ‚ùå **NO creative improvements** to designs
- ‚ùå **NO skipping component states** (hover, focus, disabled)
- ‚ùå **NO generic implementations**

- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS check figma-links.md first**
- ‚úÖ **USE exact hex colors from Figma**
- ‚úÖ **USE exact px values for spacing**
- ‚úÖ **USE exact font specifications**
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENT all component states**
- ‚úÖ **INCLUDE Figma URL in component comments**

### üõë BLOCKING ERROR RESPONSE:

When asked for UI implementation without Figma reference, respond:

```
‚ùå FIGMA REFERENCE REQUIRED

I cannot implement UI without a Figma design reference.

Required steps:
1. Check .cursor/design-references/figma-links.md for the Figma URL
2. If no URL exists, request design creation first
3. Inspect Figma design for exact specifications
4. Provide component requirements with exact values

I will not proceed without following the Figma-first workflow.
```

### üìã MANDATORY COMPONENT STRUCTURE:

Every UI component MUST include:

```tsx
/**
 * üé® FIGMA REFERENCE
 * URL: [Direct Figma link]
 * Export: [Image path]
 * 
 * EXACT SPECS FROM FIGMA:
 * - Colors: [Hex codes]
 * - Spacing: [Pixel values]
 * - Typography: [Font specifications]
 * - States: [All interactive states]
 */
```

### üéØ VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:

Before generating any UI code, verify:
- [ ] Figma URL exists and is accessible
- [ ] Design specifications are documented
- [ ] All component states are defined
- [ ] Responsive behavior is specified
- [ ] Exact values are available (not approximations)

### üíÄ NO EXCEPTIONS POLICY:

These rules cannot be bypassed by:
- "Just this once" requests
- "It's a simple component" justifications
- "I'll fix it later" promises
- "Close enough" approaches

**FIGMA IS THE CONTRACT. CODE MUST FULFILL THE CONTRACT EXACTLY.**

## üõ†Ô∏è PROJECT-SPECIFIC RULES:

### Laravel Backend:
- Use existing services (NotificationService, FinancialService, etc.)
- Follow established patterns in app/Services/
- Use FormRequest classes for validation
- Keep controllers thin, business logic in services
- Use database transactions for financial operations

### React Frontend:
- Use Inertia.js for all page navigation
- Follow existing component structure in resources/js/components/
- Use shadcn/ui components from components/ui/
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
- Use React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Database:
- Use existing 50+ table schema
- Don't create duplicate tables
- Use proper relationships and foreign keys
- Follow migration patterns in database/migrations/

### Testing:
- Use Pest framework for PHP tests
- Test with real database (RefreshDatabase)
- Mock only external services (Zoom, payment gateways)
- No mocking of internal application code

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE:

When you receive ANY UI-related request:
1. Display: "üîç Checking Figma requirements..."
2. Verify figma-links.md has the component URL
3. Extract specifications from Figma
4. Implement with exact values only
5. Include validation checklist completion

**STRICT ENFORCEMENT. NO CREATIVE LIBERTIES. FIGMA DICTATES ALL UI.**
