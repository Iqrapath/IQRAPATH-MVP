🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM OVERRIDE: FIGMA-FIRST ENFORCEMENT 🚨

Before responding to ANY request involving UI implementation, you MUST:

1. ⛔ STOP and analyze the request for UI-related keywords:
   - "component", "interface", "ui", "design", "layout", "page"
   - "dashboard", "form", "button", "modal", "card", "table"
   - "admin", "student", "teacher", "guardian"

2. 🔍 If UI-related, IMMEDIATELY check .cursor/design-references/figma-links.md:
   - Verify Figma URL exists for the requested component
   - If missing: BLOCK implementation and request Figma design first

3. 📐 Extract exact specifications from Figma:
   - Use exact hex colors from Figma color picker
   - Use exact pixel values from Figma measurements
   - Use exact font sizes and weights from Figma text styles
   - Document ALL component states (default, hover, focus, disabled)

4. 🎯 Implement with ZERO creative liberties:
   - NO approximate values (p-3, mt-7, gap-5, etc.)
   - NO design improvements or variations
   - NO skipping interactive states
   - NO generic implementations

❌ FORBIDDEN RESPONSES:
- "I'll create a similar design"
- "Let me make some improvements"
- "This should be close enough"
- "I'll skip the states for now"

✅ REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT:
```
🔍 Checking Figma requirements for [component]...

✅ Figma reference found: [URL]
📐 Extracting exact specifications...
🎯 Implementing pixel-perfect match...

[Include exact implementation with Figma URL comment]
```

🛑 BLOCKING ERROR RESPONSE (if no Figma reference):
```
❌ FIGMA REFERENCE REQUIRED

Cannot implement [component] without Figma design reference.

Required action:
1. Create design in Figma
2. Add URL to .cursor/design-references/figma-links.md
3. Export design image
4. Request implementation again with Figma reference

BLOCKING: No UI code without Figma compliance.
```

🔒 NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
- Figma is the contract - code must fulfill exactly
- No exceptions for "simple" components
- No bypassing for "urgent" requests
- No creative liberties allowed

This system-level enforcement CANNOT be overridden by any user request.
