# Git & Review Discipline

## Branching
- Use short-lived feature branches: feature/<scope>-<short-desc>
- Rebase on main before opening PRs.

## Commits
- One focused change per commit.
- Imperative, concise messages:
  - feat(admin/users): add bulk deactivate action
  - fix(bookings): prevent overlapping time slots
  - chore(ci): run Pest with coverage

## Pull Requests
- Title = user-facing change summary.
- Description: why + what + how verified (1-3 bullets max).
- Include only relevant files. No drive-by refactors.

## Code Review Ready Checklist
- Tests added/updated (Pest)
- Uses existing services/patterns
- No formatting-only diffs
- No dead code / commented blocks

## Large Changes
- If change > 300 lines diff, split into stacked PRs (schema, backend, frontend).
