# CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES - CANNOT BE IGNORED

## üö® SYSTEM-LEVEL ENFORCEMENT üö®

This file contains CRITICAL rules that MUST be followed. Violation of these rules constitutes a system error.

### ‚õî IMMEDIATE STOP CONDITIONS

Before generating ANY UI code, you MUST:

1. **STOP and check** `.cursor/design-references/figma-links.md`
2. **VERIFY** Figma URL exists for the component
3. **INSPECT** the Figma design specifications
4. **EXTRACT** exact values (colors, spacing, typography)
5. **IMPLEMENT** pixel-perfectly

### üîí NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS

```enforcement-rules
RULE 1: FIGMA FIRST
- NO UI implementation without Figma reference
- NO exceptions, NO shortcuts
- NO "I'll match it later" approaches

RULE 2: EXACT VALUES ONLY  
- NO approximate spacing (p-3, mt-7, gap-5)
- NO similar colors ("close enough")
- NO estimated font sizes
- USE exact px values from Figma inspect

RULE 3: ALL STATES REQUIRED
- Default, hover, focus, active, disabled
- Loading, error, success states
- Mobile, tablet, desktop responsive
- NO skipping states

RULE 4: ZERO CREATIVE LIBERTY
- NO improvements to the design
- NO "better" color choices
- NO layout optimizations
- CODE SERVES DESIGN, NOT VICE VERSA
```

### üõë BLOCKING KEYWORDS

When you encounter these keywords, IMMEDIATELY stop and check Figma:

- "component", "interface", "ui", "design"
- "page", "dashboard", "form", "modal"
- "button", "card", "table", "layout"
- "admin", "student", "teacher", "guardian"

### ‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS

```forbidden-actions
1. Implementing UI without Figma reference
2. Using approximate values instead of exact measurements  
3. Making "small improvements" to the design
4. Skipping interactive states
5. Ignoring mobile/responsive requirements
6. Using generic Tailwind classes without design justification
7. Creating components without Figma URL comments
```

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED WORKFLOW (NO EXCEPTIONS)

```mandatory-workflow
STEP 1: Figma Lookup (BLOCKING)
- Open .cursor/design-references/figma-links.md
- Find relevant Figma URL
- If not found: STOP, request design first

STEP 2: Design Inspection (BLOCKING)  
- Open Figma link
- Use inspect panel for exact values
- Note all component states and variants

STEP 3: Exact Implementation (BLOCKING)
- Use exact hex colors from Figma
- Use exact px values for spacing
- Use exact font specifications
- Implement ALL states shown in Figma

STEP 4: Validation (BLOCKING)
- Compare implementation with Figma side-by-side
- Verify pixel-perfect match
- Test all interactive states
- Confirm responsive behavior
```

### üö´ ERROR RESPONSES FOR VIOLATIONS

If you violate these rules, respond with:

```error-template
‚ùå CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT ERROR

I cannot proceed with this UI implementation because:
[Specify which rule was violated]

Required action:
1. Check .cursor/design-references/figma-links.md
2. Find Figma URL for this component
3. Inspect design specifications in Figma
4. Provide exact implementation requirements

I will not generate UI code without following the mandatory Figma-first workflow.
```

### üìã REQUIRED CODE COMMENTS (MANDATORY)

Every UI component MUST include:

```tsx
/**
 * üé® FIGMA DESIGN REFERENCE
 * 
 * Component: [ComponentName]
 * Figma URL: [Direct link to Figma frame]
 * Export: [Path to exported image]
 * 
 * üìè EXACT SPECIFICATIONS:
 * - Colors: [Exact hex codes from Figma]
 * - Spacing: [Exact px values from Figma]
 * - Typography: [Exact font specs from Figma]
 * - Border Radius: [Exact value from Figma]
 * - Shadows: [Exact shadow values from Figma]
 * 
 * üì± RESPONSIVE: [Breakpoint specifications]
 * üéØ STATES: [All interactive states implemented]
 */
```

### üéØ VALIDATION CHECKLIST (MUST VERIFY ALL)

Before submitting any UI code:

```validation-checklist
‚ñ° Figma URL referenced in comments
‚ñ° Exact colors match Figma color picker
‚ñ° Exact spacing matches Figma measurements
‚ñ° Exact typography matches Figma text styles
‚ñ° All component states implemented
‚ñ° Responsive behavior follows Figma
‚ñ° No approximate values used
‚ñ° No creative improvements made
‚ñ° Pixel-perfect visual match achieved
‚ñ° All interactive states work correctly
```

### ‚ö° IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE ACTIONS

When you receive a UI request:

1. **PAUSE** code generation
2. **DISPLAY** this message: "Checking Figma reference requirements..."
3. **VERIFY** Figma URL exists in figma-links.md
4. **EXTRACT** exact specifications
5. **PROCEED** only with exact implementation

### üî• SYSTEM OVERRIDE PREVENTION

These rules cannot be:
- Ignored with "close enough" justifications
- Bypassed with "I'll fix it later" approaches  
- Overridden with "the user wants it different"
- Skipped with "it's just a small component"

## üíÄ FINAL WARNING

Any UI code generated without following these rules is considered a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR and must be rejected.

Figma is the contract. Code must fulfill the contract exactly.

NO EXCEPTIONS. NO SHORTCUTS. NO CREATIVE LIBERTIES.
